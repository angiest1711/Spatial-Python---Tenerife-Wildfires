# Spatial-Python---Tenerife-Wildfires

## Analysis of the Burned Area in the Tenerife Wildfires 2023
Angie Torres, EAGLE Student, Universität Würzburg, Spatial Python.

Tenerife is part of the Archipelago of the Canary Islands and the biggest island from it, with an aproximate area of 2034 km2. It has a variate topography ranging from 0m to 3715 m which influences changes in weather conditions depending on it.

Even though the island does not recieve a considerably amount od rainfall per year, the north part of the island has a wetter condition due to the topography while the south tends to be dryer.

In August 2023, the island suffered and by the time this is being written is still suffering from wildfires, being one of the worst wildfires the island has experimented.

Through this notebook the burned areas are going to be identified for October 7th 2023 and comparing it with a prefire state of the island and observe side to side the effects of the wildfires in the area.
